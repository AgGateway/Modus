While the Primary Licensee is a member of AgGateway, Licensor grants license to distribute the Digital Resource.  A Primary Licensee, while a member in good standing of AgGateway, may grant a Secondary Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use the Digital Resource but not to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works, display, or distribute the Digital Resource.
 
### 3. Redistribution.

A Primary Licensee may reproduce and distribute copies of the Digital Resource, or Derivative Works thereof, in any medium, with or without modifications, provided that the Primary Licensee meets the following conditions: (i) the distribution is required to enable integration activity with a Secondary Licensee; (ii) access to the Digital Resource or Derivative Work is authorized for authenticated users only; (iii) the Primary Licensee must give the Secondary Licensee a copy of this License in its entirety or provide a link to the License (to which the Secondary Licensee agrees to be bound); (iv) the Primary Licensee must retain attribution and license inclusion of the Digital Resource as acquired; and (v) for Derivative Works, the Primary Licensee must provide attribution and license inclusion as close as practicable to that which was acquired with the Digital Resource.  No attribution or license information is required for on-screen displays (e.g., a user-interface in a browser-based application) but use of the Digital Resource name (e.g., “Notify Shipment,” “Crop Protection Product Identification Implementation Guidelines,” “Ag eStandards Invoice”) is encouraged.  Where the AgGateway license is impractical to include in its entirety, the Primary Licensee may use the following statement:  “AgGateway licenses this file according to the license agreement at [https://aggateway-license.s3.amazonaws.com/AgGateway_License_2023-08-04.pdf](https://aggateway-license.s3.amazonaws.com/AgGateway_License_2023-08-04.pdf).”

### 4. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Digital Resource.

### 5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Digital Resource on an _**"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND**_, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Primary Licensee and Secondary Licensee is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using the Digital Resource and assumes any risks associated with the exercise of grants under this License.

### 6. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, strict liability or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Licensor be liable to a licensee for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or exemplary damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use of the Digital Resource (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

### 7. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Digital Resource or a Derivate Work thereof, a Primary Licensee may choose to offer warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, a Primary Licensee may act only on its own behalf, not on behalf of Licensor, and only if the Primary Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Licensor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, Licensor by reason of extending any such warranty or additional liability.
