# Agricultural Lab Test Data Exchange

## Exchanging soil test data is important, but currently difficult
Current trends in sustainability, traceability, and compliance reporting demand that growers gather and report ever-increasing amounts of data to justify their operations. Considering that soil test data is the most commonly used data layer in digital agriculture, and drives much agricultural decision-making, its reporting (both in commercial and regulatory settings) may likely become the norm.

## What do standards have to do with this?

•	Errors are costly: Trying to scale without data standards can lead to errors. The insufficient or excessive application of crop nutrition inputs that follow can affect margins and create regulatory liability.

•	Less friction = more scalability: Interoperability is a bottleneck: soil testing is a low-margin activity, and scaling becomes very difficult for the soil test laboratories in the absence of clearly established standards (labs currently have to deal with over 70 data formats). Making data exchange easier will help labs scale and be more efficient.

•	Turnaround is a competitive advantage: The one-week turnaround for soil data is a thing of the past. Fall application now happens right behind the combine; hitting the window of opportunity to collect representative samples and generate test results in time for the application gives laboratories very little time to test. 

•	Automated data management, from work order generation, sample collection, drying analysis and result distribution, will improve labs’ efficiency and allow them to increase their sample throughput. In this competitive environment, the laboratories that can offer the best turnaround without compromising the quality of analysis will gain significant market share and be more profitable.

•	Farm Management Information Systems are a big piece of this puzzle. Enabling grower-, advisor- and retailer-facing farm management software to produce work orders and consume test results will require automation.

## AgGateway has a solution for how to make this work!

Recognizing these challenges and their importance for the success of Digital Agriculture, AgGateway created the Laboratory Data Standardization Working Group. This group’s goal is to partner with the laboratory community and help implement standards and formats that will initially focus on the MODUS format that many labs are already using. The first deliverable will be an update to the existing Modus schema creating more consitiency and better information for each test method included in the standard. Addtionally, AgGateway will proivde more transparent governance and licesning enabling broader use of the standard and improved ability to adapt to changes and the needs of the industry. 

## Together, let’s take MODUS to a new level!
•	MODUS emerged from the collaboration among a group of companies, academics, and soil test laboratories.

•	It’s currently a set of XML schema files and code lists of laboratory tests.

•	It is the most widely adopted format among North American soil labs.
