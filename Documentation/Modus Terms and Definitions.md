| **Matrix**              | The broad category of the substance being tested                                           | soil, water, manure, nematode, plant tissue, feed, …                                                        |
| **Analyte**             | Elements, physical properties, or ratios that can be quantified or observed                | lower case unless element abbreviation                                                                      |
| **Extraction Name**     | A commonly accepted name for the method, generally the extraction agent or named after the person that developed the method. |                                                                                                             |
| **Extraction Reagent/formulation** | The reagent or formulation used in the test method, e.g. 0.1 M HCl                                |                                                                                                             |
| **Extraction Ratio**    | The ratio of soil to extractant for the method                                             | Need details here on when to use N/A vs leave blank vs saturated paste vs Field Capacity. Do blank cells mean 1:1? |
| **Extraction Basis**    | The type of units used for the extraction ratio, e.g. Mass/Mass                            |                                                                                                             |
| **Extraction Time**     | The amount of time for the soil extraction, acceptable values are expressed in minutes if less than 4 hours, hours if up to 48 and in days for times greater than 48 hours. Additionally, if there is any heating required for a time that is noted it should be in degrees Celsius. If there are multiple steps each with their own duration, it can be documented here. | <4 hours expressed as minutes <48 hours expressed as hours >48 hours expressed as days Degrees Celsius       |
| **Analyte Measurement** | Instrumentation used to perform the measurement analysis                                   | Calculation?                                                                                                |
| **Reporting Unit**      | The unit of measure the test method result is reported in from the lab. The units shall not include any units that require assumptions or additional context such as reporting in lb/ac that assumes a depth and density of soil to arrive at the value. For Modus 2 codes the team also agreed upon specific units for each dimension, any new methods should use an existing UoM from the list. → Note: The assumption is Modus will be used for communication between systems so human readability is not required, so using g/kg may result in more decimal places but will not change the values. Systems can still choose to display values to users in whatever units they choose. | % cm/hr cmol/kg Description dS/m g g/cm3 g/kg lb/ac/day meq/L mg/L mg/m2 nmol/h/mg None Ratio S.U. tons/ac |
| **Observation Category** | For methods that directly quantify a single value use Measured, for methods that are a ratio of two different analytes, or are the result of a calculation to arrive at the value use Calculation. | Measured, Calculated, Observed                                                                              |
| **Acceptance**          |Experimental: The method only used in research, or in non-commercial capacity Provisional: The method is only available on a limited basis or is not widely accepted in the industry. Proprietary: The method is only available at specific laboratories due to intellectual property related to the method or reagents. Official: The method is widely used and has an official citation for the method. | Experimental, Provisional, Proprietary, Official                                                            |
| **Status**              |**Valid**: The semantic resource is actively being used for new and existing semantic resources</p>**Invalid**: The semantic resource should not be used, because it is in error or otherwise unsuitable for use. It is kept in the infrastructure for forensic / reference purposes.</p>**Retired**: The semantic resource should not be used to support new data. It was valid in the past, and retained to support historic data. It is not automatically assumed to have been replaced by a new, valid entry.</p>**Superseded**: The semantic resource should not be used to support new data, because there is a new item that should be used instead. The item in question was valid in the past, and is retained in order to support historic data. It is assumed to have been replaced by a new, valid entry, which it will reference.</p>**Candidate**: A state allowing a public comment period for new entries that aren't automatically approved, exists in this status for approximately 30 days before either being officially added or removed if issues arise.</p>**NOTE**: During development of the 2.0 Modus codes if there was not sufficient information known about a version 1 method to fully attribute a v2 entry it was marked Retired under the assumption anyone still using the code would submit a change request with full method documentation.|Valid<br>Invalid<br>Retired<br>Superseded<br>Candidate|
| **Citation Organization**  |The organization responsible for the publication or maintenance of the test method procedure |  |
| **Citation**  |The citation to where the documented process for the test method can be found. |  |
