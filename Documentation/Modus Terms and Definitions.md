| **Matrix**  | The broad category of methods used for the analysis of a given substance   | soil, water, manure, nematode, plant tissue, feed, â€¦
| **Manure**  | Methods to measure nutrient content as well as other properties that can benefit crop growth. Manure testing helps determine appropriate application rates and potential environmental impacts.  | 
| **Compost**  | Methods to evaluate the properties of organic matter that has been decomposed, primarily for use as a soil amendment. The methods include analytes such as nutrient value, stability, and suitability for enhancing soil health.   | 
| **Soil**    | Methods used to assess key parameters of soil to inform nutrient management and other agronomic decisions for the area the samples represent.   | 
| **Plant Tissue/Botanical** | Methods to measure the concentrations of essential plant nutrients in plant leaves and other parts. Analytical results are used to evaluate crop nutrient status, detect toxicities, and correct deficiencies. <br> **Note:** Plant tissue analysis is not applicable to forage crops for use as animal feed. | 
| **Water** |  Methods used to analyze water to detect contamination, nutrient content, or other properties to inform use for irrigation or measure runoff from a field. | 
| **Feed** | Methods used to evaluate the nutritional content and quality of animal feedstuffs. This analysis helps in formulating balanced diets and ensuring optimal animal health and productivity.   |
| **Nematodes**  | Methods used to assess the presence and population levels of nematodes in soil or plant tissues. Nematode assays help diagnose potential crop damage and guide management practices. | 
| **Microbiological**  | Methods used to analyze the microbial communities and biological activity in soil. This testing helps understand soil health, nutrient cycling, and the impact of agricultural practices on soil ecosystems. | 
| **Analyte**              | Elements, physical properties, or ratios that can be quantified or observed  | nitrogen, potassium, lower case unless element abbreviation 
| **Extraction Name**     | A commonly accepted name for the method, generally the extraction agent or named after the person that developed the method.  |   Mehlich 3
| **Extraction Reagent/formulation** | The reagent or formulation used in the test method  | 0.1 M HCl 
| **Extraction Ratio**    | The ratio of sample to extractant for the method  | 1:10
| **Extraction Basis**    | The type of units used for the extraction ratio  | Mass/Mass 
| **Extraction Time**     |	The amount of time required for the method, acceptable values are expressed in minutes if less than 4 hours, hours if up to 48 and in days for times greater that 48 hours. Additionally, if there is any heating required for a time it should be in degrees Celsius. If there are multiple steps each with their own duration, it can be documented here. | <4 hours expressed as minutes <br> <48 hours expressed as hours <br> >48 hours expressed as days 
| **Analyte Measurement** | Instrumentation used to perform the measurement analysis     | ICP                                                                                          |
| **Reporting Unit**      | The unit of measure the test method result is reported in from the lab. The units shall not include any units that require assumptions or additional context such as reporting in lb/ac that assumes a depth and density of soil to arrive at the value. For Modus 2 codes the team also agreed upon specific units for each dimension, any new methods should use an existing UoM from the list.<p><br>**Note:** The assumption is Modus will be used for communication between systems so human readability is not prioritized, so using g/kg may result in more decimal places but will not change the values. Systems can still choose to display values to users in whatever units they choose. | %, cm/hr, cmol/kg, Description, dS/m, g, g/cm3, g/kg, meq/L, mg/L, mg/m2, nmol/h/mg, None, Ratio, S.U. <p> <br>UoM codes will follos the ADAPT UoM format: <br> g/cm3 = g1[cm3]-1|
| **Observation Category** |	The way in which the property is observed | **MEASURED:** The value is directly quantified <BR> **CALCULATION:** A ratio of two different analytes, or the result of a calculation to arrive at the value <BR> **OBSERVED:** A human observation that is not directly quantified such as color 
| **Acceptance**          |  How widely used or accepted a method is within the industry.  | **EXPERIMENTAL:** The method only used in research, or in non-commercial capacity <br> **PROVISIONAL:** The method is only available on a limited basis or is not widely accepted in the industry.<br>**PROPRIETARY:** The method is only available at specific laboratories due to intellectual property related to the method or reagents. <br>**OFFICIAL:** The method is widely used and has an official citation for the method.                                                         |
| **Status**              | The status of the method code. <p>**NOTE**: During development of the 2.0 Modus codes if there was not sufficient information known about a version 1 method to fully attribute a v2 entry it was marked Retired under the assumption anyone still using the code would submit a change request with full method documentation. | **VALID:** The code is actively being used without limitation <br>**INVALID:** The code should not be used, because it is in error or otherwise unsuitable for use. It is kept in the list for forensic / reference purposes.<BR>**RETIRED:** The code should not be used to support new data. It was valid in the past, and retained to support historic data. It is not automatically assumed to have been replaced by a new, valid entry.<BR>**SUPERSEDED:** The code should not be used to support new data, because there is a new item that should be used instead. The item in question was valid in the past, and is retained in order to support historic data. It is assumed to have been replaced by a new, valid entry, which will be reference in the Modus2 Code Supersession file in the same folder of the GitHub repo as the method list.<BR>CANDIDATE: A state allowing a public comment period for new entries that aren't automatically approved, exists in this status for approximately 30 days before either being officially added or removed if issues arise.
| **Citation Organization**  |The organization responsible for the publication or maintenance of the test method procedure |  |
| **Citation**  |The citation to where the documented process for the test method can be found. |  |
